# This is my bot for the virtual hackathon competition. The only work that is my own is the MyBot.java file.

### As a first time AI player, I was not confident in my ability to achieve the top ranks of this competition. However, I found the challenge to be more approachable when I started to treat this as a learning experience.

#### Through this process, I learned two crucial things:
#### 1. Learn the initial design of the game. There is no need to reinvent the wheel, as there are a vast library of functions that are really useful.
#### 2. Simple and efficient algorithms are the way to go. A simple algorithm that works will beat a bot with a complicated algorithm that doesn't.
